#1. 
>Write a function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.

#2. 
>Write a function to converting an Integer to a string in any base.

#3. 
>Write a function of recursion list sum.

**Test Data :** ```[1, 2, [3,4], [5,6]]```

**Expected Result :** ```21```

#4. 
>Write a function to get the factorial of a non-negative integer.

#5. 
>Write a function to solve the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.

#6. 
>Write a function to get the sum of a non-negative integer.

**Test Data :** 
```
sumDigits(345) -> 12
sumDigits(45) -> 9 
```

#7. 
>Write a function to calculate the sum of the positive integers of n+(n-2)+(n-4)... (until n-x =< 0).

**Test Data :** 
```
sum_series(6) -> 12
sum_series(10) -> 30 
```

#8. 
>Write a function to calculate the harmonic sum of n-1. 

**Note :** The harmonic sum is the sum of reciprocals of the positive integers. 

**Example :**
```harmonic series```

#9. 
>Write a function to calculate the geometric sum of n-1.

**Note :** In mathematics, a geometric series is a series with a constant ratio between successive terms. 

**Example :**
```harmonic series```

**Test Data :**
```(power(3,4) -> 81```

#11. 
>Write a function to find  the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers.
